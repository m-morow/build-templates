Prepare the cardboard shroud, filter top, and filter base using the template provided. Tape the sides of the cardboard (optionally tape the entire cardboard pieces) to improve the seal. Keep in mind, a few layers of duct tape will affect the fit of pieces.

Tape the cardboard shroud to the front of the box fan, where the air exits the fan. Make sure to tape off any gaps between the edge of the shroud and box fan.

Tape the 2 filters at the triangle point, making sure to take note of flow direction (found on the sides of the filter). I measured the widest part of my triangle at 23.5‚Äù. The arrow pointing in the direction of flow should point into the triangular compartment. Tape any gaps between the filters.

Flip the filters upside down, and tape the filter base to the 2 filters. Make sure to close any gaps with tape.

Flip the filter and base right-side up, and tape the filter top to the filters. Make sure to close any gaps with tape.

Set the box fan on the small lip from the filter base cardboard. Make sure the box fan is as close to the filter and cardboard as possible. Decide where the box fan power cord will exit the C-R filter. Tape the box fan to the filter and cardboard, sealing any gaps with tape.

Plug the C-R filter in! As a double-check, place a piece of paper next to the air filter. It should stick to the filter when you let the paper go, indicating the air flow direction is being pulled into the air filter and out of the box fan.
